# TASK DESCRIPTION
#########################

### The data ############
# You've been provided with 22 thirty-second sound files, spanning 11 minutes.
# The user of the device coughed 10 times during this 11 minute period.
# The exact timestamps of these coughs are in `ground_truth`
# `samples_df` has the mapping of the 30 second files, along with the time ("timestamp") at which time the 30 second
# recording started

### The task ############
# Write a function in python which takes a sound file as an argument
# and returns a dataframe of times (number of second since file start) at which a cough occurred.
# This is an event detection task in which it is far better to OVER-detect than
# to UNDER-detect. In regards to tuning prec/recall, you should consider
# a correctly detected cough to be worth 10 "points" and a "false positive"
# (ie, a "peak" which is not a cough) to be worth -1 points.
# The simpler, the better. No need to use Tensorflow, pre-trained models, or anything like that.
# Feel free to use libraries, but know that this is not a test of your modeling skills.
